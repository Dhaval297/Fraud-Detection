# Fraud-Detection
Identify the credit card fraud detection. 
Train a model with the help of both Unsupervised and supervised Learning.
Use a dumy dataset of a bank.

# Unsupervised Learning 
With the help of Self Organizing map identify the outliners or the fraud in the given dataset.

# Self Organizing Map 
Self organinizing map are used to visualize all the independent variables on single plane by generating some co-relation bewtween the
variables

# Supervised Learning 
Now with the help determined frauds. We trained a model using Artificial Neural Network to determine chance of fraud in new entry of the Customers.
